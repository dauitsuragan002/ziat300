# Ziat300 ‚Äì Chrome (browser) Extension for Summarizing Web Pages in Kazakh and Multiple Languages

![logo](images/screen1.png)

Ziat300 is a Chrome extension that summarizes the content of web pages in Kazakh, English, or other supported languages. Powered by artificial intelligence Gemini, it reads the content of any web page and generates either a short or full summary in the selected language.

**It also features Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality, allowing users to listen to the generated summary in their chosen language. TTS is powered by Microsoft Edge TTS (msedge-tts) via a Node.js server.**

## üì¶ Overview

This Chrome extension allows users to take the content of the currently open web page and summarize it in Kazakh or English. The extension analyzes the content using AI and generates a short or full summary in the selected language. The summary is displayed in a popup window in Chrome.

## üíª Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chrome Extension API
- **msedge-tts (Microsoft Edge Text-to-Speech, Node.js)**
- express, cors

## üöÄ Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dauitsuragan002/ziat300.git
   ```

2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner

4. Click the "Load unpacked" button

5. Select the folder you just downloaded

6. The extension is now installed!

## üó£Ô∏è How to Run Edge TTS Server (Node.js)

1. **Install dependencies** (in the `src` folder):
   ```bash
   cd src
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the TTS server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

3. **How it works:**
   - The server exposes a POST endpoint at `/tts`.
   - Send a JSON body with `text`, optionally `voice` and `rate`.
   - Example request (using `fetch`):
     ```js
     fetch('http://localhost:3000/tts', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ text: '–°”ô–ª–µ–º, ”ô–ª–µ–º!', voice: 'kk-KZ-AigulNeural' })
     })
     .then(res => res.blob())
     .then(audioBlob => {
       // Play or save the audio
     });
     ```
   - The response will be an MP3 audio stream of the spoken text.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

1. Go to the web page you want to summarize
2. Click the Ziat300 icon in the top right corner of Chrome
